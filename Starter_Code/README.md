    Part one scrapes data from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html and composes a dictionary containing article titles and their summary. 

    Part 2 takes a table from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html and converts it into a pandas dataframe. An analysis is conducted using the data.
